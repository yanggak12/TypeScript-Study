## What is TypeScript
 
  TypeScript stands in an unusual relationship to JavaScript. 
  TypeScript offers all of JavaScript’s features, and an additional layer on top of these: TypeScript’s type system.
  
  Your existing working JavaScript code is also TypeScript code. The main benefit of TypeScript is that it can highlight unexpected behavior in your code, lowering   the chance of bugs.\
